  <p align=left><b>PodnLearn</b> is a <i>Podcast and AI-based e-book learner web application</i> in which the user, particularly, the listener can access a wide range of podcasts with also some of the exclusive indie podcasters, as the user can also upload its own podcast and become a podcaster.

  <br><br>
  <p align=left>Another feature which comes with the podcast is the <b><i>“LearnAI”</i></b>, in which you can upload a pdf of a book, basically an e-book, which will convert the text written in it, into a voiceover speech, as if you are listening to an audiobook. A user can access its e-books right in the app, anywhere they want to. The LearnAI will help the people who has difficulties in eyesight. Not only that, but also it will be beneficial for the students who wants to save time and be productive. What it means that the student can listen to its book by doing other chores too, which will, of course, help them to save some time.</p>

  <p align=left>To access the application, the user may have to first register, or login if they have an existing account. Once the user logs in, they can get ample number of contents and features to listen to. Using the APIs and AI, the user can access the popular podcasts, too. Also, the AI is helping in translating the text to speech and vice versa in the LearnAI feature.
